Events are a mechanism supporting decoupled communication between components. They are part of the underlying <Link to="/development/api">API abstract class</Link> meaning they are available to all child classes. The usage for Events is simple and familiar.

On a given service, you can subscribe to a topic using the `on()` method, or you can fire an event using `trigger()`.

The best example of this is the usage as part of the <Link to="/architecture/authentication">authentication flow</Link>.

In a number of the methods within the Auth API, the `trigger()` method is called.
```javascript
this.trigger('auth_updated', {
    method: 'switch_context',
    data: {
        user: body.data.user,
        business: body.data.business,
        refresh_token: body.data.tokens.refresh,
        access_token: body.data.tokens.access,
    }
});
```

    <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/xedi/sdk-js/blob/master/src/Services/Auth.ts#L144">
        Auth.switchContexts
    </ExternalLink>
</Caption>

Subscribing to the `auth_updated` topic is also as straightforward as this.
```javascript
Xedi.Auth.on('auth_updated', (event) => {
    console.log(`Auth state updated by ${ event.model }`);
    console.log(`Current user: ${ event.data.user.first_name });
    if (event.data.hasOwnProperty('business')) {
        console.log(`Current business: ${ event.data.business.name }`);
    }
});
```
