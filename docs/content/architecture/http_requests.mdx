XEDI.js includes Axios in its bundle. It is contained so should not interfere with other instances of Axios you may be running.

Axios allows XEDI.js to be used in browsers and (in theory) in Node.js applications.

<Flash scheme="yellow" mb={2}>
    <InfoIcon mr={1} /> Node.js applications aren't currently supported.
</Flash>

Just like the API classes, XEDI.js uses an instance of Axios.
