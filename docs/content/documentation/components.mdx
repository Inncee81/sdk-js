import {Box} from '@primer/components';
import {StatusLabel} from '@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat';

As previously mentioned, it has been required that a number of components be built to make the documentation better.
Here is quick breakdown of each one.

## External Link

<Box mb={2}>
<StatusLabel status="New" />
</Box>

Useful for defining a link external of this site that will cause the browser to load a new page.
```jsx live
Click <ExternalLink href="https://xedi.com">here</ExternalLink> to learn about an awesome EDI company!
```

## Github Issue

<Box mb={2}>
<StatusLabel status="New" />
</Box>

Provides information about a specific Github Issue.

```jsx live
<GithubIssue issue-id="2" />
```

Works well when combines with a `<BorderBox></BorderBox>`
