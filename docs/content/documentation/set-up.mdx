import {BorderBox, Flash} from '@primer/components'
import {Caption} from '@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat'
import InlineCode from '@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat/src/components/inline-code'
import {InfoIcon} from '@primer/styled-octicons'
import {GithubIssue} from '../../src/components'

All documentation, including the framework and it's dependencies, are in the `docs/` directory. This should be your working directory.

## Environment

<Flash mb={2}><InfoIcon mr={1} />At present, you must use a copy of node locally on your machine to compile and use XEDI.js documentation. In the future, this will be containerized.

    <GithubIssue issue-id="58" />
</BorderBox>

</Flash>

Due to runtime bug in node 14.3, one our dependencies is unable to build. As such, you must use either:

* `10.20.1` (`lts/dubnium`)
* `12.17.0` (`lts/erbium`)

As soon as this is rectified, this requirement will be removed.

### Variables

To allow various functionalities of the documentation to work, a personal access token is required. This should be placed within a `.env` file in the root of the `docs/` directory.

```shell
GITHUB_TOKEN=<my personal access token>
```
<Caption>.env</Caption>

## Local Builds

The documentation framework ships with a development server that allows hotswap development.

```shell
npm run develop
```
<Caption>Launching the development server</Caption>
This triggers a build, followed by the provision of a localhost link. It defaults to port <InlineCode>8000</InlineCode>, however if something is already using that port, the framework will use the next numerically available port.

<Flash mt={2}><InfoIcon mr={1} />If you are XEDI staff, when you go to <InlineCode>http://localhost:8000</InlineCode> you may find that your browser automatically may redirect your to <InlineCode>http://localhost:8000/dashboard</InlineCode>. This is because Traefik, our development loadbalancer issues a <InlineCode>308 Permanent Redirect</InlineCode> response when you go to <InlineCode>http://localhost:8000</InlineCode>

In this event, you will be greeted with a "Development 404" page. Simply select one of the pages in the site map displayed centrally in the page.
