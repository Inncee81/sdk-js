import {Link} from '@primer/components';

Within the `docs/` directory, there are a number of important directories and files to be aware of. You probably already know about the `package.json` and `.env` file. If not, read the <Link href="/documentation/set-up">Getting Started</Link> section.

## Content

The `content` directory holds our content. An important note is that the folders you use should match your desired URLS. For example, if I was writing a **character profile** for **Luke Skywalker**, I might want the URL to be `/characters/luke_skywalker`. So my folder structure should match this, therefore my file path should be `docs/content/characters/luke_skywalker.mdx`.

## Sidebar Navigation

The Sidebar navigation is generated from the content in `src/@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat/nav.yml`. Each entry in `nav.yml` should have a `title`, `url`, and an optional `children` list to create nested navigation links.

```yml
# src/@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat/nav.yml
- title: Example
  url: /example
  children:
    - title: Nested Example
      url: /nested/example
```
There are some caveats though:

* Doctocat (the theme) only supports **one** level of nesting.
* Links are **not** alphabetized; but rendered in the order they are specified.
* Items without urls default to the index page.

## First Party Components

Between `@primer/components` and `@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat`, there are a lot of useful components, however it can be useful to create additional components to consolidate multiple components into one, or to add additional functionality.

These are stored in `docs/src/components/` and enumerated for export in `docs/src/components/index.js`.
